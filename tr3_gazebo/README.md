# tr2_gazebo

## Dependencies
Mimic - https://github.com/roboticsgroup/roboticsgroup_gazebo_plugins
The gripper fingers use the mimic feature in this plugin in order to enable publication of joint commands to a single joint, g0. You can install the plugin by cloning it to your ROS workstation (e.g. ~/ros_ws/src) and building the projects (e.g. catkin_make).
